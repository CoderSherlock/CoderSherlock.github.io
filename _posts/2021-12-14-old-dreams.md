It's almost my graduation.
Hence, something need to be noted for my whole Ph.D. period.
I planned to start this writing when I was first notified of the acceptance of the second paper.
Same location, 4 years passed.
    
It was the first time I had a first author publication and it all came at the second months I formally start my program.
You can imagine how much graceful when I heard the news.
However, after that, time froze.
And the consequence is no more throughput in the later 4 years.
