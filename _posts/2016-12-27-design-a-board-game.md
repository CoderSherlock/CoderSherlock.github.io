# History
I always want to design a board game, but unfortunately, I have higher expectation on this design so that I can even finish one during these years. My dreaming work must be suit for both entertainment and competition, which both amateurs or pros can enjoy this game.          

My first designed board game is *"SimCity ~ Board version"*. It was a great fun when I was in forth grade of elementary. Compare to a board game, it's more like a paper-version web game. I offer everything include game design, a "database" (notebook) to record all players status. At beginning, it wasn't that popular, but my classmates love it. With several weeks running, 30 players joined this silly game and students from other classes came for me to join my game. During three month testing, I released more than **120** new buildings, **15** new activities and even made this game payable. It sounds stupid, but lots of them rather pay 50 cents for accelerating their construction. I also faced competitors, but no one wants to play their bad designed game. At least for myself, I won't spent players' 20 hours for just a nuclear plant, offer them a lottery that every players whose level is up to 20 can get chance to win their own plants (Trust me, my lottery only have 0.01 chance that you win nothing, and anyone can get free tickets everyday and only pay 10 cents for a spare lottery ticket). Of course, my board game didn't last for long. Before final weeks, I made a statement that game will closed. At the evening after statement, I wrote wealthy rank for all players to let all of them know who wins or lose.   

This history always encourage me to design a new board game, but this time I am not facing to young boys and girls who don't have too much to play at school. I admit this is a serious challenge to me but I'll try my best to make this game fun to play.

# My dream

- Better for two players
- Competitive
- Do have fortune features, but good strategy can guarantee winning
- Simple, better to be PnP (Print and Play)

# Preparation

## Warm-up
[Island-Combat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V_czXDnFuQfNyzLM7R5FUrX0vYD9QR17R3FQQ25pjZY/edit?usp=sharing) is my first idea. I designed it in Chinese, but you may free to guess what these figures mean.
