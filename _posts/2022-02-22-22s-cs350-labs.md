This will be a series regarding lab I gave during the spring 2022 semester.
  
The reason why I am writing this down is because it has been a week and no students ask for the solution of the last Lab.
I realise that learning gap between students are huge, especially when a non-profit university is admitting more and more students.
To help all students in understanding concepts of modern OS, I decided to write this post.
  
It starts with the past lab content I have (as the skelton), and will be amended with extra materials I think it helps.
Remember, it's for helping in learning. DON'T COPY & PASTE CODE!
