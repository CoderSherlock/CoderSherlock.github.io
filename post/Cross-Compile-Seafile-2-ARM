# Cross Compile Seafile to ARM platform

## Motivation
This project is working for delta sync from mobile to server. Currently, there's no mobile program/solution has supporting to delta sync(Include Dropbox/ Goggle Drive). But the truth is that almost every pc version sync program can work as delta sync properly or not. So in this article, I'll provide a workbench for cross compilation and evaluation. And finally come up with a reason of how to port better incremental synchronize solution on mobile platform.
