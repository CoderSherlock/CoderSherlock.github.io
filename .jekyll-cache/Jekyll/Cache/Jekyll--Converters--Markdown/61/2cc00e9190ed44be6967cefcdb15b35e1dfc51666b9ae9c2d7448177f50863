I"Ó<p>In this blog, I will generally talk about how to use proper tools to monitor SSL traffics of a mobile devices. Currently, I only can dealing with those SSL traffics which use an obviously certification. Some applications may not using system root cert or they doesnâ€™t provide us a method to modify their own certs. For these situation, I still didnâ€™t find a good solutions for it. But Iâ€™ll keep updating this if I get one.<br />
My current solution is using AP to forward all SSL traffic to a proxy, <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">charles proxy</a> is my first choice (Prof asked). Itâ€™s a non-free software which still update new versions now. So mainly, Iâ€™ll talk about how to charles SSL proxy.</p>
